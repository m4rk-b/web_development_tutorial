Branching and Merging:
git branch "Name of your branch" -> Creating a branch
git merge "Branch name" -> Merging the branch to main
git branch -> To check the project branches, branch with '*' is the active branch
git checkout "Branch name" -> To switch to the created branch

git commit -m "Commit message"
git push -u origin branch-name

To commit the changes:

git commit

NOTES: 
1. Initially the name of the 'main' branch is 'master', to modify the name run: git branch -M main
2. Always check github for merge requests
